# MilaUI

MilaUI is a custom user interface add-on for World of Warcraft. It bundles
several modules including improved unit frames built on top of oUF and a
cursor customization module.

## Installation

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Copy the `Mila_UI` folder into your `World of Warcraft/_retail_/Interface/AddOns` directory. Use
   `_classic_` or another appropriate game folder if you play on a different client.
3. Launch the game and enable **MilaUI** on the AddOns screen.

## Basic Usage

Once in game you can access the configuration GUI and commands:

- `/mui` or `/mila` – open the main configuration window.
- `/mui reset` – restore default settings.
- `/mui cursor toggle` – enable or disable the cursor module.
- `/mui cursor status` – print the current cursor module settings.

Most options are also available through the interface options panel opened via the
slash commands above.
